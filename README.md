# Scientific Research
This repository is dedicated to a scientific research project focused on **solving inverse problems in mathematics** using advanced computational techniques. It explores the application of **machine learning, deep learning, and optimization** to tackle these challenging problems, which involve inferring causes from observed effects.

The repository is structured to ensure **full reproducibility** of the research. It contains the following key components:

* **Code Implementations:** Includes all source code used for model training, validation, and testing. The code is well-documented and organized, allowing other researchers to easily understand and replicate the experiments.
* **Datasets:** Both **raw and processed datasets** are provided. The raw data represents the initial observations, while the processed data is the refined input used for the models. This distinction allows for a clear understanding of the data pipeline.
* **Research Paper:** A comprehensive paper is included, detailing the **methodology, results, and conclusions** of the project. This paper serves as a guide, explaining the theoretical framework, experimental setup, and the significance of the findings.

The goal of this project is to contribute to the field by demonstrating the effectiveness of modern computational methods in solving complex inverse problems, which have applications across various scientific disciplines, including medical imaging, geophysics, and material science.
